**When**: Wednesday, 6^th^ of December

**Where**: Roche, Basel

## Description {#description}
Have you ever struggled with slow R code? Have you ever wondered how to make it go fastR and fully leverage the power of high performance compute (HPC) clusters? If yes, this training is for you! You will learn how to profile, optimize, and parallelize your code on your local machine, as well as how to parallelize it on HPC clusters. While we will provide example code for commonly-performed activities for trial design, such as simulation studies, bootstrapping and cross-validation, to get the most out of this training, we strongly encourage you to *bring your own (non-confidential) code to optimize on a Posit-provided HPC in the cloud* during the second half of the training. You will also get to pick our brains on how to best optimize your code. 
 
### Details {#details}

The first half of the training is classroom-based with interactive exercises hosted on Posit Workbench connected to a cloud-based HPC cluster that participants will get access to. We cover the following topics:

Identifying bottlenecks in your R code, debugging, and optimizing

* Debugging R code & checking correctness
* Profiling R code to identify bottlenecks
* Optimizing bottlenecks: packages, vectorization, memory allocation

R parallelization on HPC clusters

* Amdahl’s law and limits of achievable speed up
P* arallelizing work onto compute clusters via clusterMQ and batchtools
* Consistently loading code, packages, .libPaths() and options() on R workers
* Uncorrelated random number generation for parallel R code
* Debugging R code in batchtools and clusterMQ jobs

For the second half, we highly encourage you to bring your own code and attempt to optimize and parallelize it with the help of the course instructors. You can also try some of the provided examples and explore optimization and parallelization on the provided HPC cluster with those.
We look forward to your participation!
